# Naturalis RDF Store and SPARQL Endpoint

This repository contains the ETL code for populating the Naturalis RDF store as well as code implementing a SPARQL endpoint for querying the RDF store. The store is populated from the Naturalis Data Store (NDS), the Elasticsearch backend of the [NBA](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis_data_api).
